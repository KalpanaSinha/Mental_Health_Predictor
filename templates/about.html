                <br>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 18px;">
              We are a team of final year B-tech undergraduates from the CSE department of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. <br>
              We are attempting to build an easy tool for employers to monitor and assist the mental well-being of their employees. 
              <br> <br>
              We believe that Our mental health encompasses our psychological, emotional and social well-being. This means it impacts how we feel, think and behave each day. Our mental health also contributes to our decision making process, how we cope with stress and how we relate to others in our lives.
              <br><br>
              Emotional and mental health is important because itâ€™s a vital part of your life and impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or caregiving. It plays an important part in the health of your relationships, and allows you to adapt to changes in your life and cope with adversity.
